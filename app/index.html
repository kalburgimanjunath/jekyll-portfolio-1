	<h1 class="title">Welcome</h1>
	<p class="intro">Recently graduated from <a href="http://lboro.ac.uk">Loughborough University</a> with a 2:1 in Computer Science. Now working in London for <a href="https://www.micros-ecommerce.com">MICROS eCommerce</a> as a Front End Developer in the Studio team.</p>
	<p>As is my way, I've made all of the website from the ground up, using only a couple of third-party libraries such as <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://modernizr.com/">Modernizr</a>. Please feel free to view the <span id="view-source">source code</span> and see how I do what I do best, it will probably give a better representation of my skills than any content I could put on the site.</p>

	<h2 class="title">A Little History</h1>
	<p class="intro">I have been making websites since I was about 13; steadily upgrading and improving as my skills progress. Up until late 2009, when I started at University, I was completely self-taught.</p>
	<p>In 2007 I purchased my first domain (mstrutt.co.uk) and migrated all of my previously free-hosted sites onto subdomains of this. This move gave me a lot more freedom to progress and expand as I pleased, and today is still an excellent platform for my creativity.</p>
	<p>While at University I worked freelance on projects for friends, family, and small businesses. Then in the summer of 2011 I did a year-long professional placement as a User Experience Developer with <a href="https://www.micros-ecommerce.com">MICROS eCommerce</a>, where I have since been offered a permanent position.</p>
