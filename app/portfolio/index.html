			<h2 class="title">Thorntons</h2>
			<p>For the Thornton's website we were working with a different platform from usual. There was a lot of work to get the code from the back-end ready for front-end styling. The deadline was very tight but I feel we did very well under the circumstances. The main areas I worked on are 'Checkout' and 'My Account'.</p>

		<div class="info">
			<h2 class="title">Taylor Walker</h2>
			<p>Taylor Walker is one of the white label sites based on the <a href="#chefandbrewer">Chef &amp; Brewer website</a>. I was part of a small team redoing all of the CSS and in some parts HTML to give apply a Taylor Walker look and feel to the website.</p>

			<h2 class="title">MICROS eCommerce Website</h2>
			<p>With the incorporation of Snow Valley into MICROS came the need for a rebranding and redesign of the company website. I lead a small team of contractors in this project to get the website from design to completion in just one week.</p>

			<h2 class="title">Virgin Atlantic Travel Money</h2>
			<p>The Virgin Atlantic Travel Money website is my favourite of the <a href="http://travelmoney.moneycorp.com/">Money Corp</a> white label sites that I worked on. The challenge was to implement the highly customised design using only CSS as the HTML was shared code, all with a very tight deadline.</p>

			<h2 class="title">Chef &amp; Brewer</h2>
			<p>This was the first of several <a href="/blog/2012/04/responsive-vs-adaptive">adaptive</a> websites we made for Spirit Pub Companies. I was involved from an early stage and coded significant amounts of the website. This was used as the basis for the white label sites that followed.</p>

			<p>On this site I styled a redesign of the homepage and extended that look and feel accorss the "Custom Made" maps section of the website. This included a dynamic feature showing preview text on the chosen map cover.</p>

		<div class="info">
			<h2 class="title">Sole Trader Mobile</h2>
			<p>This was the first soletradermobile build I worked on for MICROS eCommerce. Although there was an existing back end system, I rewrote almost all of the HTML and CSS to get the desired look and function of the mobile site. It was built with expansion in mind and scales well to medium sized devices.</p>

			<h2 class="title">Punch Buying Club</h2>
			<p>Punch is one of our largest clients, and there's always a series of enhancements being performed on the site in one way or another. I worked on several of these enhancements though as this is a members only site, it's not really something I can demonstrate.</p>
