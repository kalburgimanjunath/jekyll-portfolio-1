		<p>Initially this started out as a way of automatically generating a backup stylesheet for browsers that don't support media queries (mainly IE8). The main stylesheet could be written in a mobile-first way, and then styles from any queries matching a given viewport could be extracted and server to legacy browser.More recently, thanks to a contributor, this functionality has been extended to facilitate the creation of viewport-specific stylesheets.</p>

		<p>The project is written in JavaScript and uses a functional approach. Currently the implementation is tied to grunt, but I hope to refactor this into a pure node project with Grunt and Gulp wrappers separately, to make it more usable and maintainable.</p>

		<p>A little side project I created to help test responsive site at breakpoints you may not have tried. It uses PHP to load the specified url within an iframe, then using JavaScript to dynamically set its size.</p>

		<p>There are two main uses for the site, the first is the truly random: generating random width and height values within the bounds of small mobile and extra-large desktop. The second uses PHP to pull in screen size statistics from statcounter, then sort these into a list with their rotated variant available alongside.</p>

		<p>Due to its use-cases, I decided there wasn't really any way to use this from a mobile device, and as such, it is not response</p>
